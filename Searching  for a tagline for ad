 --The special_instructions column stores the data where Davie’s Burgers customers leave a note for the kitchen or the delivery.
--Instead of selecting all the columns using *, write a query that selects only the special_instructions column.
--Limit the result to 20 rows.
SELECT special_instructions FROM orders LIMIT 20;

--There seem to be a lot of empty values in that column. That is because customers sometimes leave the notes section blank.
--Can you edit the query so that we are only returning the special instructions that are not empty?

--Let’s search for special instructions that have the word ‘sauce’.

--You have found special instructions that are funny and ridiculous - the perfect combo for a Davie’s Burgers tagline.
--The marketing agency took it from there and worked out a subway ad in no time!
